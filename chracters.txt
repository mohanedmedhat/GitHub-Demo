Either is grammatically correct, but given context one is more likely to be better.

If I am referring to something like a collection of artwork from different artists I might say, …a lot of works. If I am referring to the labor used to organize and display them I might say, …a lot of work. Work typically ref to the verb meaning labor, though it can be used as a noun as ‘a work of art’ it is not interchangeable with ‘job’ although ‘It’s a lot of work’ and ‘This will be quite a job’ do mean the same thing. I can also say ‘I am going to work’ (noun AND verb) but ‘I am going to my job’ (noun only) so the subtleties of these words can sure be tricky, I see your confusion. So your intended meaning determines which is best in this case, not grammar. ‘Works’ as a noun and not a present tense verb is kind of rare in its use. Mostly used to refer to artwork(s). See also Public Works, Waterworks, and Fireworks.
